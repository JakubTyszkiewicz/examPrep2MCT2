kubernetes 1:
What is kubernetes?:
Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, 
that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. 

What is kubernetes doing?:
-Kubernetes can manage organize and scake deployments of docker containers.
-Can deploy docker containers across multiple (virutal) machines
-Allows users to acces certain applications and block acces to others
-Can automate deployments.

Work process:
Task -> Develop the application -> create docker container for the applications -> launch it on kubernetes

Architecture:
A Kubernetes cluster consists of a set of worker machines, called nodes, that run containerized applications. 
Worker nodes host the Pods that are the components of the application workload. 
The control plane manages the worker nodes and the Pods in the cluster. In production environments, the control plane usually runs across multiple computers and a cluster usually runs multiple nodes, providing fault-tolerance and high availability.”

See pp picture

Control Plane / Kubernetes Master
Scheduler
Makes sure that the number of desired pods is always running
Keeps track of capacity and resources of nodes
Assigns work to nodes based on availability
Controller: responsible for registering nodes and monitoring health
etcd
A persistent and distributed key-value data store
Stores the state and configuration data for the entire cluster
API-server: main access point to the control plane and master node

Building blocks kubernetes:
-Pods ->group of containers working together
-Services and EndPoints -> abstraction that defines lgical set of pods
-Deployments ->is a YAML object that defines the pods and the number of container instances, called replicas, for each pod
-ReplicaSets -> YOU DEFINE NUMBER OF REPLICAS RUNNING WITH CLUSTER
-DaemonSets -> ensures that all (or some) Nodes run a copy of a Pod
-StatefulSets -> a StatefulSet manages Pods that are based on an identical container spec. 
-Ingress ->
-PersistentVolumes and PersistentVolumeClaims
-ConfigMaps and Secrets-> Decouple configurations from hard-coded environment variables
