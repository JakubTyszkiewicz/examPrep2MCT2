Lab1: Docker introduction

What is docker?:
Ecosysteem for running and creating containers.

Waarom gebruiken we docker?:
Docker want to make it possible to run and install any software on any system.

Microservices:
Software development technique that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupeld servives.(Microservices does not mean contenatisation but it`s an logical step)

Monolithic Containerized application:
An application that has most of it`s functionality within one proces/container.

Moore`s law:
The number of transistors on microchips doubles every 2 years.

Data center:
A physical location that stores computing  machines and their related hardware equipment.
Data center is devided in Units and Power Usage.

Hardware virtualization:
A technology that enables multiple virtual machines to run simultaneously on a single physical computer. (In order to use hardware virtualization you need an Hypervisord example: Oracle virtual box)

Virtual machines:
An abstraction of physical hardware truning one server into many servers.

SSD:
Solid state disk.

Kernel:
Piece of software that offers basic functionalties to the OS. (bridge between hardware and software, size of a kernel 1MB-30MB morden ones more than 50MB)

Shared kernel:
Docker shares the host OS kernel.
Ubuntu requiers Linux kernel(but i ran it on Windows)?:
You can use Oracle Virtual Box or WSL(Windows subsysteem for linux).

WSL?:
Compatibility layer that enables to run Linux distributions natively
Allows to run Linux without a virtual machine.

Containers:
One or multiple running proces.
2 main components of a container:
Namespaces = Isolating resources per process (or group of processes)
Cgroups = Limiting resource usage per process (or group of processes)

Image:
Filesysteem snapschot. (instance of an image = container)

OS:
Manges hardware, software and provides services.
