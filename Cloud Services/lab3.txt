Blob:
• Block Blob: Used for unstructured data, such as files. By default, it doesn't have
folders, only a container. This can be addressed by enabling ADLS Gen 2.
• Page Blob: Suitable for random read and write operations, often used for VM
disks.
• Append Blob: Designed for appending blocks, particularly useful for logging.
• Table:Stores data as key/value pairs in a table, representing semi-structured data.
