Lab1: Introduction Azure Cloud

What is cloud computing?
Delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, 
and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, 
and economies of scale.

Properties of cloud computing:
- no hardware of your own
- unlimited computing power 
- unlimited storage capacity
- Scaling up and down on demand or automatically
- Scaling in and out on demand or automatically
- Geographical distribution
- Pay what you use

Kinds of cloud computing:

1. On premise
• IT Department is responsible for EVERYTHING
• Backup & recovery
• Hardware purchase
• Sometimes investing in hardware that you only
need for a limited number of days ex: webshop
and Christmas period
• Scaling...
• Most freedom to work
• Sometimes required by legislation
• Medical data
• Financial data
• Lack of trust with public cloud provider (cfr
NSA)

2. IaaS (infrastructure as service)
• Don't buy your own hardware
• We rent virtual machines in Cloud
environment
• System administrator must configure and
secure and update server himself
• A lot of flexibility towards software
installation
• A lot of freedom but also responsibility
• You have to do scaling yourself (sometimes
auto scaling possible)
• Widely used for migration existing On
Premise to cloud

3.PaaS (plaform as service)
• No system administrator needed
• Developer creates application and
"places" it on the Cloud platform
• We should not worry in servers,
hosting, backups, scaling,... The
platform will manage this for us
• A lot of flexibility

We will mainly use this in the Cloud Services node_modules

4.SaaS (software as service)
• Software usually does not run locally
(exception Adobe & Office)
• We pay per month/per user
• Flexible subscriptions, quick to set up
• We should not take into account
backups and up time

5.Hybrid Cloud (On Premise & Cloud)
• Connect your own data center to a cloud environment
• Certain services run in a cloud environment, others in their own data center
• Run heavy load on the cloud
• Certain data may NOT be stored in the cloud, e.g. medical
• Can also be used in backup scenarios

Public Cloud Vendors:
-AWS 
-Azure
-Google Cloud

Why do we choose Microsoft Azure?
- Open source
- Good tool and documentation
- Very low entry for students

Azure regions?:
-Azure Regions are physical locations around the world where Microsoft Azure’s
data centers are located. Each region contains multiple data centers that are
equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking

Purpose of Azure regions:
- Redundancy and Availability: Regions are set up to provide redundancy and
ensure high availability for applications and services by distributing them across
different locations.
- Compliance and Data Residency: Certain regions are designed to meet specific
data residency and compliance requirements, which is essential for industries like
healthcare, finance, and government.

Examples of Azure Regions:
United States: North US, East US
Europe: North Europe, West Europe
Asia: East Asia, South East Asia

Paired regions:
Azure links regions in pairs within the same geography to ensure data resiliency
and to support disaster recovery.

Considerations When Choosing a Region
- Latency: Choose a region close to your users to reduce latency.
- Compliance: Ensure the region complies with local data regulations.
- Service Availability: Not all Azure services are available in every region; verify
that the services you need are offered in your selected region.
- Cost: Costs may vary between regions, so consider your budget when
choosing a region.

Azure subscriptions:
- Subscription will determine how they invoice
- Different options
- Buy credits in advance
- Pay by use
- In practice: one subscription per customer
- For our lessons this does not matter so much we have the "free subscription"

Azure Portal:
Tool for managing your Cloud services and applications

Resource group:
A container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. 

Azure Virtual Machines (IaaS)
1. Private server on Azure environment
• Mostly on-premises server that we virtually move to Azure
2.A lot of possibilities
• File servers
• Database servers
• Webservers
• Application servers
• AI Training Servers with NVidia H100
• …
3. Access resources on server that are not possible via a web application
• Bv. communication with older software packages
• Generation of Word/Excel documents
DISCLAMER full control over an solution.
