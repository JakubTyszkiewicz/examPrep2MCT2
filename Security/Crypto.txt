Crypto:

Encryptie:
-geheimhouding
-authenticatie
-integriteit

Symmetrische Encryptie:
Geheimhouding
GEEN authenticatie
Eenvoudig
SNEL
Voorbeeld: DES
• Block-cipher van 64 bit
• 16 encryptiecycli met telkens andere subkey
• Bitlengte van de sleutel is bepalend, 56bit is
   tegenwoordig te laag

Asymmetrische Encryptie:
Public key encryptie; voorbeeld: RSA, ECC
Geheimhouding
Authenticatie
Werkt met sleutelPAREN
• Private sleutel
• Publieke sleutel
Zeer berekeningsintensief

Hashing:
-Message Digest; voorbeeld: MD5, SHA2, …
-Variabele inputlengte
-Vaste outputlengte
-Kleine inputvariate resulteert in grote outputvariatie
-Niet reversibel

Diffie-Hellman exchange:
uitwisselen van een shared key

PKI: public key infrasctucture:
-Encryption of data in transit
-Key exchange
-Authentication of client
-Authentication of server

-Confidentiality
-Integrity

PKI - certificates:
Trusted door CA(certificate authority)
implementation:
-CA has public and private key
-“CA Client”  (server) has public and private key
-Public key of the “client” is signed by the CA
-Certificated server is trusted by the client as the client trusts the CA

Signing = Asymmetrische cryptographie + hashing = signing:
-Content is hashed
-The hash is encrypted with the private key of the CA
-Thus, the hash value can be decrypted by anyone using the public key of the CA
-It is certain that the hash was authentic as only the private key of the CA could have encrypted the hash that can be decrypted by the public key of the CA
-The content is hashed, and this hash is compared with the decrypted hash value

Certificate properties:
-Serial number
This number distinguishes the certificate from other certificates.
-Algorithm information 
    The issuer uses this algorithm to sign the certificate.
-Issuer
    This is the name of the CA that issued the certificate.
-Validity period of the certificate 
    These are the start and end dates that define when the certificate is valid.
-Subject distinguished name 
    This is the name of the identity to which the certificate is issued.
-Subject public key information 
    This is the public key that is associated with the identity.
